# Build Sylva Living World

The original procedural moss-root world with pale flowers, ferns, drifting pollen, scan light, and a landing butterfly.

## Verified source material

- `src/shaders/sylva-living-world/SylvaLivingWorldScene.tsx`
- `src/shaders/sylva-living-world/sources/inner-green-3d.html`
- `src/shaders/sylva-living-world/sources/inner-green-assets/three.min.js`

Source revision: `SHA-256 fd922291297d`

## Requirements

- Preserve the complete Three.js r149 renderer and every published Community option.
- Preserve its interaction contract: Pointer-driven moss parting, camera parallax, pollen trails, scan-light entrance, and butterfly flight.
- Preserve its assets: No binary assets — the canonical HTML and local MIT Three.js runtime are carried as source.
- Verify resize, mobile, reduced motion, visibility, teardown, and console health.
