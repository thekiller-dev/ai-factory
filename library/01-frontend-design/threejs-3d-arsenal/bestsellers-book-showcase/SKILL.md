# Build Bestsellers Book Showcase

## Description

The complete Field Manuals book showcase, preserved unchanged with its editorial layout, authored motion, interactions, and embedded media.

Recreate the authored behavior from the verified source, not from screenshots or the abbreviated orchestration sample in this skill. The implementation may live directly in the target project and does not require `@designcodeio/threeui`.

## Technologies

- React iframe host
- Byte-exact complete authored HTML document
- Same-project local source URL
- All original media embedded in the authored HTML

## Verified source material

- `src/shaders/landing-pages/LandingPages.tsx`
- `public/landing-pages/bestsellers-book-showcase.html — byte-exact complete page`

Source revision: `SHA-256 7c1ed1ca4a4c`

## Implementation steps

1. Open every verified source file listed above and identify the renderer, host lifecycle, styles, and assets before editing.
2. Copy the complete Bestsellers Book Showcase HTML file byte-for-byte to /landing-pages/bestsellers-book-showcase.html; do not extract, rewrite, shorten, or rebrand any section.
3. Preserve every embedded style, script, media payload, text string, interaction, responsive rule, and document-level lifecycle.
4. Keep every relative local asset at the exact path expected by the original document.
5. Load the local document in a full-size iframe whose permissions retain the authored forms, modals, downloads, popups, scripts, and same-origin resources.
6. Lazy-load only the React host bundle; do not import the complete HTML into the application JavaScript graph.
7. Give the local component a sized, overflow-controlled parent and verify desktop, mobile, reduced-motion, and context-loss behavior.

Asset handling: Copy bestsellers-book-showcase.html byte-for-byte; its authored media remains embedded in the document.

## Local component example

Import the copied local component rather than a package entrypoint:

```tsx
import { BestsellersBookShowcase } from "./effects/bestsellers-book-showcase/BestsellersBookShowcase";
import "./effects/bestsellers-book-showcase/styles.css";

export function Scene() {
  return <div className="effect-frame"><BestsellersBookShowcase /></div>;
}
```

## Core renderer pattern

This excerpt documents orchestration only. Copy the exact shader, geometry, pass, and interaction code from the verified source files.

```tsx
<LandingPageFrame title="Bestsellers Book Showcase" sourceUrl="/landing-pages/bestsellers-book-showcase.html" />
```

## Behavior contract

- Runtime: Full HTML + DOM/CSS + embedded media
- Passes: 1 sandboxed full-document renderer
- Interaction: Original pointer, keyboard, scroll, navigation, and showcase interactions
- Assets: All visual and video data remains embedded in the original HTML
- **document** (fixed): Complete original bestsellers-book-showcase.html, byte-for-byte
- **sourceUrl** (fixed): /landing-pages/bestsellers-book-showcase.html
- **headingFont** (optional): Iowan Old Style | Instrument Serif | Newsreader | Geist
- **bodyFont** (optional): Iowan Old Style | Geist | Newsreader | Instrument Serif
- **headingWeight** (optional): 400 | 500 | 600 | 700
- **bodyWeight** (optional): 400 | 500 | 600 | 700
- **primaryColor** (optional): Hex color
- **typography** (optional): Heading size + body size + heading letter spacing
- **layout** (responsive): Original full landing page inside the preview frame
- **interaction** (original): Scroll + pointer + keyboard + media controls
- **assets** (embedded): Original embedded media

## Verification

1. Compare the rendered composition, animation timing, pointer behavior, and state transitions with the source implementation.
2. Exercise resize, high-DPI, mobile/coarse-pointer, reduced-motion, tab visibility, and WebGL context-loss paths where applicable.
3. Confirm every animation frame, observer, listener, geometry, buffer, texture, framebuffer, material, and renderer is released on teardown.
4. Check the browser console and confirm the effect renders at native-or-better backing resolution.

## Guardrails

- Do not substitute a visually similar package, demo, shader, or runtime.
- Do not approximate, reconstruct, or simplify the authored GLSL, render passes, geometry, interaction state, or assets.
- Keep exact source and asset hashes under regression tests when the source project provides them.
- Adapt only the surrounding host boundary needed by the target project; keep renderer behavior intact.
