# Build Structure Flow

## Description

Thirteen authored Three.js field studies collected as one family, spanning particle domes, horizons, orbital systems, matrices, topology, fluid fields, embers, and vortexes.

Recreate the authored behavior from the verified source, not from screenshots or the abbreviated orchestration sample in this skill. The implementation may live directly in the target project and does not require `@designcodeio/threeui`.

## Technologies

- React typed variant host
- Thirteen authored Three.js r128-r160 field renderers
- Point clouds, ShaderMaterials, topology scenes, fluid fields, embers, and post-process bloom
- Lazy-loaded renderer-specific lifecycles and controls

## Verified source material

- `src/shaders/structure-flow/StructureFlowCollection.tsx`
- `Axiom-Structure-Flow (2).html — Three.js background`
- `src/shaders/structure-flow/structureFlowRenderer.ts`
- `src/shaders/structure-flow/StructureFlowBackground.tsx`
- `src/shaders/emerald-horizon/EmeraldHorizonBackground.tsx`
- `src/shaders/orbital-sphere/OrbitalSphereBackground.tsx`
- `src/shaders/dot-matrix/DotMatrixBackground.tsx`
- `src/shaders/neuform-isolated/NeuformIsolatedEffects.tsx`
- `src/shaders/neuform-isolated/NeuformCraftEffects.tsx`
- `src/shaders/neuform-isolated/NeuformBatchEffects.tsx`

## Implementation steps

1. Open every verified source file listed above and identify the renderer, host lifecycle, styles, and assets before editing.
2. Use StructureFlowCollection as the family entry point and select the exact authored renderer with the variant prop.
3. Keep Structure Flow, Emerald Horizon, Orbital Sphere, Dot Matrix, Expanse Field, Logic Core, Dimensional Field, Data Field, Topology Field, Nebula, Fluid Field, Ember Storm, and Flux Vortex as independent scenes rather than blending them into one renderer.
4. Preserve the source-exact Three.js revision, geometry, shaders, camera, palette, motion, and pointer behavior for every variant.
5. Expose each renderer's own controls at the variant boundary and lazy-load only the selected implementation.
6. Retain every source renderer's resize, visibility, animation-frame, context, and disposal lifecycle.
7. Give the local component a sized, overflow-controlled parent and verify desktop, mobile, reduced-motion, and context-loss behavior.

Asset handling: This effect has no required external assets.

## Local component example

Import the copied local component rather than a package entrypoint:

```tsx
import { StructureFlowCollection } from "./effects/structure-flow/StructureFlowCollection";
import "./effects/structure-flow/styles.css";

export function Scene() {
  return <div className="effect-frame"><StructureFlowCollection variant="emerald-horizon" /></div>;
}
```

## Core renderer pattern

This excerpt documents orchestration only. Copy the exact shader, geometry, pass, and interaction code from the verified source files.

```tsx
<StructureFlowCollection variant="flux-vortex" speed={1} density={1} />
```

## Behavior contract

- Runtime: Three.js r128–r160
- Passes: 1–2 Three.js scene, point-cloud, or ShaderMaterial passes
- Interaction: Variant-specific pointer, motion, geometry, opacity, mask, and palette controls
- Assets: No external assets
- **renderer** (variant): Three.js r128–r160
- **variants** (fixed): 13 field studies
- **controls** (adaptive): Renderer-specific
- **assets** (fixed): None

## Verification

1. Compare the rendered composition, animation timing, pointer behavior, and state transitions with the source implementation.
2. Exercise resize, high-DPI, mobile/coarse-pointer, reduced-motion, tab visibility, and WebGL context-loss paths where applicable.
3. Confirm every animation frame, observer, listener, geometry, buffer, texture, framebuffer, material, and renderer is released on teardown.
4. Check the browser console and confirm the effect renders at native-or-better backing resolution.

## Guardrails

- Do not substitute a visually similar package, demo, shader, or runtime.
- Do not approximate, reconstruct, or simplify the authored GLSL, render passes, geometry, interaction state, or assets.
- Keep exact source and asset hashes under regression tests when the source project provides them.
- Adapt only the surrounding host boundary needed by the target project; keep renderer behavior intact.
