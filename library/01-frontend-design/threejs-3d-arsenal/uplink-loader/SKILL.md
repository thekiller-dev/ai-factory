# Build Uplink Loader

A cinematic secure-uplink loader with stepped progress, illuminated telemetry ticks, neon readouts, technical corner markers, mirrored side rails, scanlines, and procedural grain.

## Verified source material

- `src/shaders/uplink-loader/uplink-loader.html`
- `src/shaders/uplink-loader/UplinkLoader.tsx`

Source revision: `SHA-256 f73bb2963501`

## Requirements

- Preserve the complete DOM + CSS + JavaScript renderer and every published Community option.
- Preserve its interaction contract: Autonomous stepped progress sequence with phase labels, completion hold, and reset glitch.
- Preserve its assets: No owned binary assets.
- Verify resize, mobile, reduced motion, visibility, teardown, and console health.
